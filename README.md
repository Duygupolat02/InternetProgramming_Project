# InternetProgramming_Project
 First of all, this is a project for a class called “Internet Programming”. Our teacher Dr. Nilgün Incereis tasked us with this homework, that is why, we created a city events website. The Culturel City Events website and project we created, aims to provide a platform where users can explore and discover various events happening in Istanbul. Since Istanbul is a crowded city and the heart of Turkish Republic, the website provides diverse range of events, from cultural festivals to art exhibitions, that are taking place in the city. That is why, as a group we chose this city we live in. As for the website, users can navigate through different sections such as Home, Events, Gallery, and Contact to access relevant information and stay updated on upcoming events. 
 At this point we also want to give our gratitude for our teacher, for teaching us this class and giving such an enjoying homework to improve ourselves. It has been an amazing project to work on, along with seeing the interesting software field “Front-End” at firsthand.
